## 📖 The Deep Learning Workflow

### 1. Data Acquisition
Gather labeled data from various sources including public datasets, APIs, web scraping, or crowd-sourced annotations.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
Clean data, handle missing values, scale features, and convert categorical data and text to numerical formats.

### 3. Dataset Splitting
Divide data into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets to ensure proper model evaluation.

### 4. Model Building & Training
Design neural network architecture and train the model on the training dataset using backpropagation.

### 5. Model Evaluation
Assess model performance on validation data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize learning rate, batch size, and other parameters to improve model performance.

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Neural Networks
Computational models inspired by biological neurons with interconnected layers. The foundation of deep learning.

### Hidden Layers
Intermediate layers between input and output that enable the model to learn complex patterns and representations from data.

### Backpropagation
Algorithm for training networks by calculating gradients and updating weights to minimize loss function during training.

### Activation Functions
Mathematical functions that introduce non-linearity, allowing networks to learn complex relationships and patterns.
